# Why-App
A philosophical tool for your existential journey.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

You should install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). I'd recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for developing.

## Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ortwic/why-app.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
